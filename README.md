# Saathi

An AI powered agriculture utility platform
## Features

- Plant disease detection(Detects upto 33 classes)
- Crop recommendation based on soil quality and environmental factors
- Information about different crops



## Tech Stack

**ML/DL:** Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit

**Web:** Flask, Bootstrap

## Installation

There are 2 parts in this project

#### ML/DL

In the models directory there are two folders 'recommender-models' & 'cnn'. Recommender-models has all the models related to crop recommendation system and cnn folder contains all the notebooks and models related to plant disease classification.

#### Web

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  cd Saathi/webapp
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  python3 setup.py
```
